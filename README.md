# 💡 What Drives Me

I’m motivated by building systems that are reliable, measurable, and production-ready.

From debugging embedded firmware in latency-constrained environments to designing data pipelines and training ML models, I care about correctness, performance, and thoughtful trade-offs.

Good engineering is quiet and dependable — and that’s the standard I aim to build toward.
