# 🧭 How I Think About Systems

I approach engineering as a balance between **performance, clarity, and reliability**.

From debugging low-level ADAS firmware on ARM platforms to building ML pipelines and evaluating NLP models, I care about how systems behave under constraints — latency, scale, data integrity, and correctness.

I’m currently pursuing an **MS in Data Science at San José State University**, expanding from embedded systems into data engineering and applied ML.

# 🚀 Where I’m Headed Next

I’m seeking internship opportunities in:

- Data Engineering (Airflow, Snowflake, dbt, ETL/ELT, SQL)
- Machine Learning / NLP Engineering
- Software Engineering (Python / C++ / Systems)

I’m particularly interested in roles where systems must be **measurable, scalable, and production-ready**.

# ⚙️ Why I Build

I’m motivated by engineering problems where constraints matter.

I enjoy systems that must perform predictably — whether it's firmware running on embedded hardware, a data pipeline orchestrating scheduled jobs, or a model evaluated beyond simple accuracy.

Good engineering is reliable, measurable, and thoughtfully designed.

That’s the standard I work toward.
<!---# Hi, I’m Prerana 👋
